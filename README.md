## Overview of the project

### Project:Basic calculator

### Objective:
To develop a robust Java application capable of performing fundamental arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on user input.
### Key Activities:
 * User Interface: Implement an intuitive interface for users to:
   * Input numerical values.
   * Select the desired arithmetic operation (e.g., +, -, *, /).
 * Calculation Logic:
   * Implement core logic to accurately execute the selected arithmetic operation on the provided input values.
   * Ensure data integrity and handle potential exceptions (e.g., division by zero).
 * Output Presentation:
   * Display the calculated result in a clear and user-friendly format.
### Error Handling:
The application must incorporate robust error handling mechanisms to:
 * Validate user input: Ensure all input values are of the correct data type (numbers) and within expected ranges.
 * Handle exceptional cases: Gracefully manage and inform the user about potential errors such as division by zero.
### Technology Stack:
 * Primary Language: Java will be utilized for the development of the entire application.
 * Core Functionality: Java's built-in mathematical operators will be leveraged for performing arithmetic calculations.
